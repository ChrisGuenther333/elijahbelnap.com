My name is Elijah Belnap, and I've been working with databases since 2019. At the time I was studying Mechanical Engineering at Utah Valley University, however an internship around databases changed everything for me. I quickly fell in love with databases and began to reroute my career around them. I taught myself most of what I know, and I'm currently finishing up a bachelor's degree in Data Analytics and Management. Presently I work remote for Rocket Central (affiliate of Rocket Mortgage) as a Database Engineer.

I created this site to share my knowledge and experience with others. I figured if I learned this much on my own, others can to and I would love to help them in their journey. The best teacher is experience, so I will continually share my database experiences here. Feel free to learn more with me!

Besides data, I'm also passionate about my family, the outdoors, traveling, and drawing closer to my maker. My wife and I have one handsome son and have another one on the way. I lived two years in Argentina, have been to Mexico, and one day hope to travel to Chile where my wife is from. We currently reside in Price, Utah.
