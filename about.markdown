My name is Elijah Belnap, and I’ve been working with databases since 2019. At the time I was studying Mechanical Engineering at Utah Valley My name is Elijah Belnap, and I’ve been working with databases since 2019. At the time I was studying Mechanical Engineering at Utah Valley University, however, an internship around databases changed everything for me. I quickly fell in love with databases and began to reroute my career around them. I taught myself most of what I know, and I recently finished a bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics and Management. Presently I work remotely for Rocket Companies (parent of Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Money, etc) as a Data Engineer.

I created this site to share my knowledge and experience with others. I figured if I learned this much on my own, others can too and I would love to help them in their journey. Experience is the best teacher, so I will continually share my database experiences here. Feel free to learn more with me!

Besides my passion for data, I’m also passionate about my family, the outdoors, traveling, and drawing closer to my maker. My wife and I have two handsome sons. I lived two years in Argentina, have been to Mexico, and one day hope to travel to Chile where my wife is from. We currently reside in Nampa, Idaho.
